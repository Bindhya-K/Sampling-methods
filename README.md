# Sampling-methods
Handling imbalanced data using oversampling and undersampling techniques
1. make_classification from sklearn is used for creating dataset with 2 clases.
2. Visualize imbalanced data using scatter plot.
3. Create Logistic Regression model and evaluatethe model without balancing the classes
4. Poor recall rate 
5. Oversampling the dataset with SMOTE regular method and visualize the balanced dataset
6. Evaluate the model.
7. SMOTE build a bridge with the outlier also. Recall rate is increased but precision and accuracy got reduced
8. Evaluated with Borderline SMOTE,SVSMOTE,ADASYN
9. Undesampling techniques are used to balance the data and evaluated the model
10. NearMiss (version 1, version2,version3), Condensed Nearest Neighbhor, Edited Nearest NEighbhor, RandomUndersampler 
11. Inference: performance are not increased by undersampling methods
